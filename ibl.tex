\chapter*{Preface}

This is a course in mathematical proof. 
It is for majors who are US sophomores, although since
it requires only high school mathematics
it can be used with first year students.



\medskip
\noindent\textsc{Approach.}
This course is Inquiry-Based (sometimes called Moore method).
That is, this text is a sequence of exercises
along with definitions and a few 
remarks.
The class works through those together by
proving statements, or sometimes by providing examples or counterexamples.
The students directly grapple with the material, 
while the instructor only lightly guides, 
talking out misunderstandings, 
sometimes stumbling in the dark, and sometimes
having beautiful flashes of insight.
% In short, this approach is the difference between cover and do.
For these students, 
this is the best way to develop mathematical maturity.


\medskip
\noindent\textsc{Topics.}
We start with elementary number theory, not logic, 
for the same reason
that the baseball team's annual practice starts by playing ball, 
not with the rulebook.
Math majors readily take to proving things about
divisibility and primes, enjoying the 
intellectual challenge and verbal exchange, 
whereas an initial month of background material can be a damper.

But the background is good stuff also and 
students are aboard once they see where it takes them.
In the second and third chapters we do
sets, functions, and relations, now with the
intellectual habits we've established at the start.

However there are some topics, such as the definition of implication, 
that students need even in the
first chapter.
I have daily classes begin with some people going to the 
board to write their answers to the homework and 
I use these ten minutes for a slide or two that covers issues from
the class's current work.
This just-in-time approach keeps the class centered 
on proving things, but they get what
they need when they need it.

The only exception is that we take an interlude to explicitly cover induction,
since it is often new for students and since it requires 
their full attention.

and, for instructors new to this approach, 
a brief description of what classroom techniques work for me.

\noindent\parbox{.95\textwidth}{\raggedright\textit{At the first meeting of the class Moore would define the basic terms and either challenge the class to discover the relations among them, or, depending on the subject, the level, and the students, explicitly state a theorem, or two, or three. Class dismissed. Next meeting: "Mr Smith, please prove Theorem 1. Oh, you can't? Very well, Mr Jones, you? No? Mr Robinson? No? Well, let's skip Theorem 1 and come back to it later. How about Theorem 2, Mr Smith?" Someone almost always could do something. If not, class dismissed. It didn't take the class long to discover that Moore really meant it, and presently the students would be proving theorems and watching the proofs of others with the eyes of eagles.}\hspace{1.5em}--Paul Halmos}

\chapter{Number Theory}

We begin with results about the
integers $\Z=\set{..,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots}$.
In this chapter, ``number'' means integer.
In some cases, results refer to the 
natural numbers $\N=\set{0,1,2,\ldots}$.

\section{Divisibility}

\begin{df}
  For two integers $d,n$ we say that
  $d$ \definend{divides}~$n$
  if there is an integer~$k$ such that $dk=n$.
  Here, $d$~is the \definend{divisor}, 
  $n$~is the \definend{dividend},
  and~$k$ is the \definend{quotient}.
  (Alternative wordings are:
  $d$~\definend{is a factor of}~$n$,
  or $d$~\definend{goes evenly into}~$n$,
  or $n$~\definend{is a multiple of}~$d$.)
  We denote the relationship as
  $d\divides n$ if $d$~is a divisor of~$n$
  or as $d\ndivides n$ if it is not.
\end{df}

\begin{df}
  A natural number is \definend{even} if $2$ divides it,
  otherwise it is \definend{odd}.
  (Alternative wording is that the number \definend{has even parity}
  or \definend{has odd parity}.)
\end{df}

% \begin{nt}
  The notation $d\divides n$ signifies a relationship between two numbers.
  It is different than the fraction $d/n$, which is a number.
  We can sensibly ask ``Does $2$ divide~$5$?''\spacefactor=1000\
  but the question ``Does $2/5$?''\spacefactor=1000\ is not sensible.   
% \end{nt}

\begin{ex}[Interaction of parity with sign]
\pord.
\begin{exes}
\item If a number is even then its negative is even.
\item If a number is odd then its negative is odd.
\item If $d\divides a$ then $-d\divides a$ and $d\divides -a$.
\item If $d\divides a$ then $d\divides\absval{a}$.
\end{exes}  
\begin{ans}
\begin{exes}
\item If $n\in\Z$ is even then $n=2k$ for some $k\in\Z$.
Then $-n=-(2k)=2\cdot(-k)$ shows that the negative is also even.
\item Let $n$ be an integer and suppose that its negative~$-n$ is even.
Since the negative of $-n$ is $n$, the prior item shows that $n$ is even.
That is, $n$ is even if and only if $-n$ is even.
Thus if $n$ is not even then $-n$ is also not even.
\item Assume that $d\divides a$ for $d,a\in\Z$, so that 
$a=dk$ for some~$k\in\Z$.
For the first, that $-d\divides a$, observe that
$a=(-d)\cdot(-k)$.
For the second, observe that $-a=d\cdot(-k)$.
\item Let $d\divides a$.
The absolute value $\absval{a}$ equals~$a$ if $a\geq 0$ and equals
$-a$ if $a<0$.
For the $a\geq 0$ case, the implication that if $d\divides a$ then $d\divides a$
is trivial.
For the $a<0$ case, 
the implication that if $d\divides a$ then $d\divides -a$ was
proved in the prior item.
\end{exes}
\end{ans}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[Interaction of parity with addition]\pord.
\begin{exes}
\item The sum of two evens is even.
  The difference of two evens is even.
\item The sum of two odds is odd. 
The difference of two odds is odd.
\item Generalize the first item to arbitrary divisors~$d$.
\end{exes}  
\begin{ans}
\begin{exes}
\item Let $a,b\in\Z$ be even so that $a=2m$ and~$b=2n$ for some $m,n\in\Z$.
Then $a+b=2m+2n=2(m+n)$ is even,
and $a-b=2m-2n=2(m-n)$ is even.
\item Both statements are false: for instance $1$ and~$3$ are odd
but both $1+3$ and~$1-3$ are even.
\item A reasonable generalization is: for any $d\in\Z$
  the sum and difference of multiples of~$d$ is again a multiple of~$d$.
 
For a proof, 
let $a,b\in\Z$ be multiples of~$d$ so that $a=dm$ and~$b=dn$ 
for some $m,n\in\Z$.
Then $a+b=dm+dn=d(m+n)$ is a multiple of~$d$
and $a-b=dm-dn=d(m-n)$ is multiple of~$d$.
\end{exes}
\end{ans}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Find a counterexample to:
where $a,b\in\N$, the number $a+b$ is even if and only if $a-b$ is even.
Patch the statement\Dash that is, alter it slightly\Dash to make it true.
\end{ex}
\begin{ans}
A counterexample is to take $1,3\in\N$, since
$1-3$ is not defined on the natural numbers.  
To patch it change the $\N$ to~$\Z$:~where $a,b\in\Z$, 
the number $a+b$ is even if and only if $a-b$ is even.

For a proof suppose that if $a,b\in\Z$.
Then $a+b$ is even if and only if 
$a+b=2k$ for some $k\in\Z$,
which is true if and only if
$a-b=a+b-2b=2k-2b=2(k-b)$,
which holds if and only if~$a-b$ is even. 
\end{ans}

\begin{ex}[Interaction of parity with multiplication]\pord.
\begin{exes}
\item The product of two evens is even.
\item The quotient of two evens, if it is an integer, is even.
\item Generalize to arbitrary divisors~$d$.
\end{exes}  
\begin{ans}
\begin{exes}
\item Let $a,b\in\Z$ be even
so that $a=2m$ and~$b=2n$ for some $m,n\in\Z$.
Then $ab=2m\cdot 2n=2(m\cdot 2n)$ is even.
\item This is false since both $6$ and~$2$ are even but the quotient $6/2$
is not even.
\item The first item can generalize to: for any~$din\N$, 
the product of two multiples of~$d$ is a multiple of~$d$.

For the proof,  let $a,b\in\Z$ be multiples of~$d$
so that $a=dm$ and~$b=dn$ for some $m,n\in\Z$.
Then $ab=dm\cdot dn=d(m\cdot dn)$ is a multiple of~$d$.

(The first item can also generalize to: a product of two multiples of
$d$ is a multiple of~$d^2$.)

\item \notetext{Transitivity} If $d\divides n$ and $n\divides m$

\item \notetext{Cancellation}

\section{Interlude: induction}
Results in the prior section need only proof techniques that come naturally
to people with a mathematical aptitude.
But some results to follow require a technique 
that is not as natural, mathematical induction.

For that reason, we now pause to introduce induction.
We start with exercises about sums 
(but note that induction is not about sums,
we start with them only because they make the best first exercises).
For instance, most people have noticed that the odd numbers sum to 
perfect squares: $1+3=4$, $1+3+5=9$, $1+3+5+7=16$, etc.,
so we look to prove 
the statement, 
``The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers $1+3+5+\cdots+2n-1$ is $n^2$.'' 

Our induction proofs have two steps, two separate things to check.
For the base step we show that the statement holds for a first number;
below we will verify the truth of the statement for $n=1$.
The inductive step is more subtle;
we will verify the following implication.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{tabular}{l} 
  \textit{If} the statement holds from the base case up to and including 
   the $n=k$ case \\
  \textit{then} the statement also holds in the~$n=k+1$ case.
  \end{tabular}
  \tag{$*$}
\end{equation*}
Doing both steps  
proves that the statement is true for all~$n\geq 1$.
For one thing, the base case    
directly verifies the statement for the number~$1$.
Next, because the inductive step verifies the implication~($*$) for all $k$, 
that implication applies when~$k=1$, where it gives 
that the statement is true for the number~$2$. 
Now, with both $n=1$ and~$n=2$ established, 
apply ($*$) again to conclude that the statement is true for the number~$3$.
In this way, we bootstrap to all numbers greater than or equal to $1$.
Below is a sample proof, doing both steps.

\begin{proof}
  We show that $1+3+\cdots+(2n-1)=n^2$ by induction.
  For the $n=1$ base step note that on the left the sum has one term, $1$,
  which equals the value on the right, $1^2$.

  For the inductive step assume that the 
  formula is true for cases $n=1$, $n=2$, \ldots, $n=k$, and 
  consider the $n=k+1$ case.
  The sum is $1+3+\cdots+(2k-1)+(2(k+1)-1)=1+3+\cdots+(2k-1)+(2k+1)$.
  By the inductive hypothesis the statement is true in the $n=k$ case
  so we can substitute.
  \begin{equation*}
    1+3+\cdots+(2k-1)+(2k+1)=k^2+(2k+1)=(k+1)^2
  \end{equation*}
  This is the required expression for the case~$k+1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}
Prove by induction.
\begin{exes}
\item $1+2+\cdots+n=n(n+1)/2$
\item $1+4+9+\cdots+n^2=n(n+1)(2n+1)/6$
\item $1+8+27+\cdots+n^3=n^2(n+1)^2/4$
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove by induction that
$1+2+4+8+\cdots+2^{n-1}=2^n-1$.  
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove by induction.
\begin{exes}
  \item \notetext{Arithmetic series}
       $b+(b+a)+(b+2a)+\cdots+(b+na)=(2b+na)\cdot n/2$
  \item \notetext{Geometric series}
        $1+r+r^2+r^3+\cdots+r^n=(r^{n+1-1})/(r-1)$ for any $r\neq 1$.
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove by induction that $n<2^n$ for all $n\in\N$.  
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove that for all $n\geq 1$, sums can be reversed
$a_0+a_1+\cdots+a_{n-1}=a_{n-1}+\cdots+a_0$.   
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove each by induction.
\begin{exes}
\item For all $n\geq 2$ the number $6$ divides the number $n^3-n$.
\item If $n\in\N$ then $4\divides 13^n-1$.
\item If $n\in\N$ then
    $(1+\sfrac{1}{1})\cdot(1+\sfrac{1}{2})\,\cdots\,(1+\sfrac{1}{n})=n+1$.
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

The prior exercise illustrates that 
sometimes when you have finish a proof by induction, 
while you now are sure that the statement is true, 
you can nonetheless be left with the sense
that you are not sure really \emph{why} it is true.
For example, you can show that the second item holds in a 
way that gives more intuition by plugging $13$ into the formula for a
geometric series. 

\begin{ex}
Show that the principle of induction is equivalent to the least number 
principle.
\end{ex}



% .....................................
\section{Division}
We can generalize divisibility.

\begin{ex}
\begin{exes}
\item Where $a$ and $b>0$ are integers, there are integers $q$ and~$r$
such
that $a=bq+r$ and
$r\in\set{0,..,b-1}$.
\item
Prove that the quotient and remainder are unique.
\item 
What to do if $b\leq 0$?
\end{exes}
\end{ex}


\begin{df}
In the $a=bq+r$ equation, $a$ is the \definend{dividend} and
$b$ is the \definend{divisor}, while 
$q$ is the \definend{quotient} and~$r$ is the \definend{remainder}.  
\end{df}

Observe that (for $b>0$) $r=0$ if and only if $b\divides a$. 
Of course, 
we all know from grade school an effective procedure, an algorithm, to 
determine the quotient and remainder.

\begin{df}
Where $b>0$ then the \definend{modulus} $a\bmod b$ 
is the remainder when $a$ is divided by~$b$.
Two numbers $a,c$ are \definend{congruent modulo $b$} $a\equiv c\pmod b$ 
if they have the same modulus with respect to~$b$.
\end{df}

\begin{ex}\pord
\begin{exes}
\item $a\bmod b=b\bmod a$
\item $a\bmod b=-a\bmod b$
\item $b\bmod b=1$    
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove that $a\equiv c\pmod b$ if and only if $b\divides (a-c)$.  
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Let $a,b,c,d,m$ be integers with $m>0$ and
$a\equiv b\pmod m$ and $c\equiv d\pmod m$.
Prove each.
\begin{exes}
\item $a+c\equiv b+d\pmod m$
\item $ac\equiv bd\pmod m$
\item $a^n\equiv b^n\pmod m$ for all $n\geq 1$.    
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}\notetext{Pigeonhole principle}  Prove each.
\begin{exes}
\item Let $B$ be a finite list of numbers.
  Its maximum number is at least as big as its average.
\item If you put $n$~many papers into fewer than $n$~many 
  pigeonholes then at least one hole gets at least two papers.    
\end{exes}
\end{ex}




% .....................................
\section{Primes}
\begin{df}
Let $n$ be an integer greater than or equal to~$2$.
Then $n$ is \definend{prime} if its only divisors are itself and~$1$,
else it is \definend{composite}.  
\end{df}

\begin{ex}\pord.
An integer $n>1$ is composite if and only if it has factors $a,b$ such that
$1<a,b<n$.  
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
\begin{exes}
\item Every number greater than $1$ has a prime divisor.
\item Every number $n>1$ has a prime divisor~$p$ with $p\leq \sqrt{n}$.
\item Show that the inequality cannot be made strict.     
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[Euclid's Theorem]
There are infinitely many primes.  
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} Suppose that $p$ is a prime.  Prove each.

\section{Common divisors and multiples}

\begin{df}
An integer is a \definend{common divisor} of two other integers if it
divides both of them.
The \definend{greatest common divisor} of two integers 
is the largest of their common divisors,
except that we take the greatest common divisor of $0$ and $0$ 
to be $0$.
We write $\gcd(a,b)$ for the greatest common divisor
of $a$ and~$b$.
\end{df}

% \begin{ex}
% Generalize the definition to sets of integers.
% \end{ex}

\begin{ex}
We will focus on the two integer case.  Prove each.
\begin{exes} 
\item For any two number $a,b$ the greatest common divisor exists.
\item $0\leq \gcd(a,b)\leq\min(\absval{a},\absval{b})$.
\item If either $a$ or $b$ is nonzero then the left-hand
  inequality in the prior item is strict.
\item If $a>0$ then $\gcd(a,0)=a$.
\item $\gcd(a,a)=\absval{a}$
\item $\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(b,a)$
\item $\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(\absval{a},\absval{b})$
\end{exes}  
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}\pord.
\begin{exes}
\item $\gcd(ca,cb)=c\cdot\gcd(a,b)$
\item $\gcd(a+b,c)=\gcd(a,c)+\gcd(b,c)$
\item $\gcd(ab,c)=\gcd(a,c)\cdot\gcd(b,c)$    
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Assume that two numbers have prime factorizations 
of $a=p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_n^{e_n}$
and $b=p_1^{f_1}\cdots p_n^{f_m}$.
Prove that in the prime factorization of
$\gcd(a,b)$ the exponent of $p_i$ is $\min(e_i,f_i)$.
\end{ex}

\begin{df}
Two numbers are \definend{relatively prime} (or \definend{coprime}) if their greatest common
divisor is $1$.
\end{df}

People sometimes write $\gcd(a,b)=1$ as $a\perp b$.

\begin{ex}
\begin{exes}
\item $\gcd(a,b)=1$ iff $\gcd(b,a)=1$
\item If $\gcd(a,b)=d$ then $\gcd(a/d, b/d)=1$.
\item Is the converse true?    
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Give (and prove) a condition of the prime factorizations of $a$ and~$b$
equivalent to their being relatively prime.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}\notetext{Euclid's algorithm}
Prove that if $a=bq+r$ then $\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(b,r)$.  
\end{ex}

The algorithm for which this result is named finds the greatest common
divisor.  For instance, to find $\gcd(803,154)$ compute that
$803=154\cdot 5+33$ and apply the result to get that 
$\gcd(803,154)=\gcd(154,33)$.
Now since $154=33\cdot 4+22$ the result gives
$\gcd(154,33)=\gcd(33,22)$.
By eye we spot the answer of $11$ but continuing as though we hadn't noticed
we get $33=22\cdot 1+11$, so $\gcd(33,22)=\gcd(22,11)$.
Then $22=11\cdot 2+0$ tells us that $\gcd(22,11)=11$, and the algorithm 
terminates.

\begin{ex}
Use Euclid's Algorithm.
\begin{exes}
\item $\gcd(15,25)$
\item $\gcd(48,732)$  
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

We can perform Euclid's algorith in reverse.
For instance, from $33=22\cdot 1+11$ we can rewrite to 
express the greatest common divisor $11$ as a combination 
$11=1\cdot 33-1\cdot 22$.
The equation $154=33\cdot 4+22$ gives a way to express
the $11$ as a combination of the prior pair
$11=1\cdot 33-1\cdot (154-4\cdot 33)=-1\cdot 154+5\cdot 33$.
Backing up still further, the equation 
$803=154\cdot 5+33$
gives $11=-1\cdot 154+5\cdot (803-5\cdot 154)=5\cdot 803-26\cdot 154$
as a combination of the pair of numbers that started the
Euclid's algorithm example.

\begin{df}
A number $c$ is a \definend{linear combination} of two others $a$ and~$b$
if it has the form $c=a\cdot m+b\cdot n$ for some $m,n\in\Z$.  
\end{df}

\begin{ex}\notetext{B\'ezout's Lemma}
\begin{exes}
\item Any common divisor of $a$ and~$b$ is a divisor of 
any linear combination of the two.
\item The greatest common divisors of two numbers is a linear combination of 
those two.
\item The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the smallest positive
number that is a linear combination of the two.
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
If $a\divides bc$ and $a$ is relatively prime to $b$ then $a\divides c$.  
\end{ex}

\begin{df}
The \definend{least common multiple} of two numbers is the smallest number
that is a multiple of each.
We write $\lcm(a,b)$.
\end{df}

\begin{ex} 
\begin{exes}
\item The least common multiple of any two integers exists.
% \item Generalize to sets of integers.
\item $\lcm(a,b)=\lcm(b,a)$.
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Where the prime factorizations are $a=p_1^{e_1}\cdots p_n^{e_n}$
and $b=p_1^{f_1}\cdots p_n^{f_m}$, 
in the prime factorization of $\lcm(a,b)$ the exponent of 
$p_i$ is $\max(e_i,f_i)$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Prove that $\lcm(a,b)=ab/\!\gcd(a,b)$.
\end{ex}











%===================================================
\chapter{Sets}
\begin{df}
A \definend{set} is a collection of objects that is definite\Dash every 
object is either
definitely in the set or definitely not in the set.
An object~$x$ that is in a set~$A$ is an \definend{element}
or \definend{member}
of the set, written $x\in A$
(to denote that $x$ is not an element of $A$ write~$x\notin A$).
Two sets are equal if they have the same elements.
\end{df}
\noindent (Read $\in$ as ``is an element of'' rather than ``in'' since the 
latter word causes confusion with 
the subset relation defined below.)
As a symonym for set we sometimes use ``collection.''

We often define a set by either listing or describing its elements.
Thus we could write 
the set containing the primes less than ten 
either as $\set{2, 3, 5, 7}$ or as~$\set{p<10\suchthat \text{$p$ is prime}}$.

\begin{ex} \pord.
\begin{exes}
\item $\set{1,3,5}=\set{5,3,1}$    
\item $\set{2, 4, 6}=\set{2, 4, 6, 4}$    
\item $\set{1, 3}=\set{n\in\N\suchthat n<5}$ 
\item $0\in\Z^+$   
% \item $4\in\set{n\in\N\suchthat n^2<50}$
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{df}
The set with no elements is the \definend{empty set\/} $\emptyset$.  
\end{df}

\begin{df}
The set~$B$ is a \definend{subset} of the set~$A$
if every element of $B$ is an element of~$A$,
that is, if $x\in B$ implies that~$x\in A$.
It is denoted $B\subseteq A$.
\end{df}

\begin{ex} \pord.
\begin{exes}
\item $\set{1,3,5}\subseteq\set{1,3, 5, 7, 9}$
\item $\set{1, 3, 5}\in\set{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}$   
\item $\set{1,3,5}\subseteq\setbuilder{n\in\N}{\text{$n$ is prime}}$
\item $\emptyset\subseteq\set{1, 2, 3, 4}$
\item $\N\subseteq\Z$
\item $\set{2}\in\set{1, \set{2}, 3}$
\item $\set{2}\subseteq\set{1, \set{2}, 3}$
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} Prove for all sets $A$.
\begin{exes}
\item $A\subseteq A$ and $\emptyset\subseteq A$
\item The empty set is unique: if $A$ is empty and $B$ is empty then $A=B$.
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
\begin{exes} 
\item \notetext{Mutual inclusion}
  Prove that if $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$ then $A=B$.  
\item \notetext{Transitivity}
  Prove that if $A\subseteq B$ and~$B\subseteq C$ then~$A\subseteq C$.  
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} For each, give example sets or show it is not possible.
\begin{exes}
\item $A\subseteq B$, $B\not\subseteq C$, $A\subseteq C$
\item $A\not\subseteq B$, $B\not\subseteq C$, $A\subseteq C$
\item $A\not\subseteq B$ $B\subseteq C$, $A\subseteq C$    
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

We will always work inside of a \definend{universal set}.
For instance, while we are doing number theory we may consider 
the set of objects less than $100$,
but in the context of that discussion the universal set is $\Z$ 
so we are considering the set of integers less than $100$.

\begin{df}
The \definend{characteristic function} of a set~$A$ is a map
$\charfcn{A}$ (whose domain is the universal set) such that
$\charfcn{A}(x)=1$ for $x\in A$, and $\charfcn{A}(x)=0$ for $x\notin A$.  
\end{df}

\begin{ex} \notetext{Russell's paradox}
Consider a collection that contains everything.
That collection contains itself.
Let $C$ be the set of all sets that contain themselves, and let
$D$ be the set of all sets that don't contain themselves.
\begin{exes}
\item Show that assuming $D$ contains itself leads to a contradiction.
\item Show that assuming $D$ does not contain itself also leads to a
contradiction.  
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\section{Operations}

\begin{df}
Let $A$ be a set.
The \definend{complement} of $A$, denoted $\setcomp{A}$, is the 
set of objects that are not elements of~$A$.  
\end{df}

One reason for working inside a universal set is that it makes the complement
operation easier. 
For instance, in a discussion of number theory where $A$ is the set of 
things that are less than~$100$ we can take the complement and we needn't 
worry about picking up unwanted objects such as $\pi$.

\begin{ex}
Prove that the complement of the complement is the original set
  $\setcomp{\setcomp{A}}=A$. 
\end{ex}

\begin{df}
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
Their \definend{union} is the set of elements 
from either set 
$A\union B=\setbuilder{x}{\text{$x\in A$ or $x\in B$}}$.  
Their \definend{intersection} is the set of elements 
from both sets
$A\intersection B=\setbuilder{x}{\text{$x\in A$ and $x\in B$}}$.  
\end{df}

\begin{ex}
Give the formula relating $\charfcn{A}$ and $\charfcn{B}$ to
  $\charfcn{A\intersection B}$.
Do the same for union.
Do the same for complementation.
\end{ex}

\end{center}
In each diagram
the region inside the rectangle depicts the universal set and the 
region inside each circle depicts the set.
On the left the part in mauve shows 
the union as containing all of the two sets joined, 
the middle shows the intersection
containing only the region common to both,
and on the right the mauve region is all but the set.

\begin{df}
The \definend{difference} of two sets is $A-B=\setbuilder{x\in A}{x\notin B}$.  
The \definend{symmetric difference} is 
$A\symdiff B=(A-B)\union(B-A)$.

\section{Cartesian product}

\begin{df}
The \definend{sequence\/} 
formed from $x_0$, $x_1$, \ldots, $x_{n-1}$ is written
$\seq{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}}$.
The \definend{length} of a sequence $\lh(\seq{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}})$
is the number of entries.
Two sequences $\seq{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}}$ and
$\seq{y_0, y_1, \ldots, y_{n-1}}$ are equal if and only if
they have the same length and
the same members in the same order:
$x_0=y_0$, $x_1=y_1$, \ldots, $x_{n-1}=y_{n-1}$. 
\end{df}

\begin{ex}\pord.
\begin{exes}
\item $\set{3, 4, 5}=\set{4, 3, 5}$
\item $\sequence{3, 4, 5}=\sequence{4, 3, 5}$
\item $\set{3, 4, 4, 5}=\set{4, 3, 5}$
\item $\sequence{3, 4,4,5}=\sequence{3,4,5}$  
\end{exes}
\begin{ans}

\end{ex}

\begin{df}
The \definend{Cartesian product} of the sets $A_0$, $A_1$, \ldots, $A_{n-1}$ 
is the set of all length~$n$ sequences
$A_0\times A_1\times \cdots \times A_{n-1}
  =\setbuilder{\sequence{a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}}}{\text{$a_0\in A_0$, \ldots, and~$a_{n-1}\in A_{n-1}$}}$.

If the sets are the same then 
a sequence of length~$2$ may be called an \definend{ordered pair} and 
written with parentheses $(x_0,x_1)$
(similarly we have ordered triples, four-tuples, etc.).
In this case we often write $A\times\cdots\times A$ 
as~$A^n$.
\end{df}

Thus, we write 
Cartesian coordinates in the plane as members of

%===================================================
\chapter{Functions, relations}
\begin{df}
A \definend{function}~$f$ (or \definend{map} or \definend{morphism}) 
from \definend{domain} set~$D$
to \definend{codomain} set~$C$, written $\map{f}{D}{C}$,
consists of the two sets along with a \definend{graph}, 
a set of pairs $(d,c)\in D\times C$ that is 
\definend{well-defined}: for each $d\in D$ there is
exactly one $c\in C$ such that $(d,c)\in f$. 
Functions are equal only if they have the same domain, codomain,
and graph.

Thus a function associates each element~$d$ from the domain,
called an \definend{argument} (or~\definend{input}),
with an element~$c$ from the codomain, 
called a~\definend{value} (or~\definend{output}). 
We write $f(d)=c$ and say that $c$ is the \definend{image} of $d$ 
or that $d$ \definend{maps to}~$c$.
\end{df}

A \definend{bean diagram} pictures a function by drawing the domain and 
codomain as blobs and 
either showing the function as a whole as a simple arrow   
or showing the function's action on individual elements 
with arrows that begin with a vertical bar.
\begin{center}

  \hspace{8em}
  \grf{asy/bean_fcn_elets.pdf}{$a\mapsunder{}f(a)$ and $b\mapsunder{}f(b)$}
\end{center}
In place of $\map{f}{D}{C}$ you may see $D\mapsvia{f} C$ and
in place of $f(d)=c$ you may see $d\mapsunder{f}c$.

\begin{ex} \pord{} that each is a function.\label{FindFunctions}
\begin{exes}
\item $D=\set{0,1,2}$, $C=\set{3,4,5}$,
  $G=\set{(0,3), (1,4), (2,5)}$    
\item $D=\set{0,1,2}$, $C=\set{3,4,5}$,
  $G=\set{(0,3), (1,4), (2,3)}$

\item $D=\N$, $C=\N$,
  $G=\set{(0,3), (1,4), (2,5)}$    
\item $D=\set{0,1,2}$, $C=\set{3,4,5}$,
  $G=\set{(0,3), (1,4), (0,5)}$    
\item $D=\N$, $C=\N$,
  $G=\setbuilder{(d,c)\in D\times C}{c=d^2}$    
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

We often ignore the distinction between a function and its graph
and just
think of the function as the set of ordered pairs.
(The graph is in the definition only 
because the codomain cannot be recovered
from the set of ordered pairs, so the function must be 
given as a tuple.)

\begin{ex}
Let $D$ and $C$ be finite sets.
How many maps are there from $D$ to $C$?
\end{ex}

\begin{df}
A \definend{constant function} $\map{f}{D}{C}$ has  
$f(d_0)=f(d_1)$ for all $d_0,d_1\in D$.
\end{df}\begin{df}
An \definend{identity function} $\map{\identity}{D}{D}$ has
$\identity(d)=d$ for all $d\in D$.
\end{df}

A function may have multiple arguments; one example is 
$(x,y)\mapsunder{f}x^2-2y^2$.
We would write this map $\map{f}{\R^2}{\R}$ as 
$f(x,y)$ rather than
$f((x,y))$.
The number of arguments is the function's \definend{arity}.

\begin{df}
The \definend{range} of a function $\map{f}{D}{C}$,
denoted  $f(D)$ or $\range(f)$,
is the set
$\setbuilder{y\in C}{\text{there is a $x\in D$ such that $f(x)=y$}}$.
\end{df}

\begin{ex}
Find the range of each function in \cref{FindFunctions}.  
\end{ex}

\begin{df}
Let $\map{f}{D}{C}$.
The \definend{restriction} of $f$ to $B\subseteq D$ is
the function $\map{\restrictionmap{f}{B}}{B}{C}$ whose action is given by 
$\restrictionmap{f}{B}(b)=f(b)$ for all $b\in B$.
A synonym is that
$f$ is an \definend{extension} of~$g$.

The \definend{image} of the set $B$ under $f$, 
denoted $f(B)$ or $\image(f)$,
is the range of the function $\restrictionmap{f}{B}$.
\end{df}

\begin{df}
Let $\map{f}{D}{C}$.
The \definend{inverse image of the element}~$c\in C$ is
the set $f^{-1}(c)=\setbuilder{d\in D}{f(d)=c}$.
The \definend{inverse image of the set}~$A\subseteq C$
is the set $f^{-1}(A)=\setbuilder{d\in D}{f(d)\in A}$   
\end{df}

\begin{ex}
Prove that $f^{-1}(A)$ is the union of the sets $f^{-1}(c)$ for all $c\in A$.

\section{Composition}

\begin{df}
The \definend{composition} of
the two functions
$\map{f}{D}{C}$ and $\map{g}{C}{B}$ 
is $\map{\composed{g}{f}}{D}{B}$ given by 
$\composed{g}{f}(d)=g(f(d))$.

\end{center}
Observe that although $g$ comes first when reading the expression 
$\composed{g}{f}$ 
from left to right, 
the function that is applied first is~$f$. 
Observe also that the codomain of~$f$ is the domain of~$g$
(we sometimes use a composition where the domain of~$g$ is not the 
entire codomain, but is a superset of the range of~$f$).

\begin{ex} Let $D=\set{0,1,2}$, $C=\set{a,b,c,d}$, 
and $B=\set{\alpha,\beta,\gamma}$
Suppose that $\map{f}{D}{C}$ is given by $0\mapsunder{} a$, $1\mapsunder{} c$, 
$2\mapsunder{} d$ and that $\map{g}{C}{B}$
is given by 
$a\mapsunder{}\alpha$, $b\mapsunder{} \beta$, $c\mapsunder{}\gamma$,
and $d\mapsunder{}\alpha$.
\begin{exes}
\item Compute $\composed{g}{f}$ on all arguments or show the composition
  function is not defined.
\item Compute $\composed{f}{g}$ on all arguments or show it is not defined.
\item Find the range of $f$, $g$, and $\composed{g}{f}$.    
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Let $\map{f}{\R}{\R}$ be $f(x)=x^2$ and let $\map{g}{\R}{\R}$ be~$g(x)=3x+1$.
Find the domain, codomain, and a formula for each of
$\composed{g}{f}$ and $\composed{f}{g}$.  
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}Prove each.
\begin{exes}
\item Composition need not be commutative.
\item\notetext{Associativity} 
  $\composed{h}{(\composed{g}{f})}=\composed{(\composed{h}{g})}{f}$    
% \item $g(f(A))=\composed{g}{f}(A)$
% \item $(\composed{g}{f})^{-1}(C)=f^{-1}(g^{-1}(C))$
\end{exes}

\section{Inverse}

The definition of function specifies that for every argument there is 
exactly one associated value.

\begin{df}
A function is \definend{one-to-one} (or an \definend{injection}) 
if for each value there is at most
one associated argument, that is, if $f(d_0)=f(d_1)$ implies that $d_0=d_1$
for elements $d_0,d_1$ of the domain.
A function is \definend{onto} (or a \definend{surjection}) 
if for each value there is at least
one associated argument, that is, if for each element $c$ of the codomain
there exists an element $d$ of the domain such that $f(d)=c$.
A function that is both one-to-one and onto, so that for every value there
is exactly one associated argument, is a 
\definend{correspondence} (or \definend{bijection}, or \definend{permutation}).
\end{df}

\begin{ex}
If $D$ and~$C$ are finite sets and there is a 
correspondence~$\map{f}{D}{C}$
then the two sets
have the same number of elements.  
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} Prove.
\begin{exes}
\item A composition of one-to-one functions is one-to-one.
\item A composition of onto functions is onto.
\item A composition of correspondences is a correspondence.    
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} 
\begin{exes}
\item If $g\circ f$ is onto then $g$ is onto.
\item If $g\circ f$ is one-to-one then $f$ is one-to-one.
\item Do the other two cases hold?     
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{df}
A function \definend{inverse} to $\map{f}{D}{C}$ is 
$\map{f^{-1}}{C}{D}$ such that 
$\composed{f^{-1}}{f}$ is the identity map on~$D$ and
$\composed{f}{f^{-1}}$ is the identity map on~$C$.
\end{df}

\begin{ex} 
\begin{exes}
\item Let $\map{s}{\R^+}{\R}$ be~$s(x)=x^2$ and let
  $\map{r}{\R^+}{\R^+}$ be $r(x)=\sqrt{x}$.
  Show that $r$ is inverse to $s$.    
\item Let $\map{f}{\Z}{\Z}$ be~$f(x)=x+3$ and let
  $\map{g}{\Z}{\Z}$ be $g(x)=x-3$.
  Show that $g$ is inverse to $f$.
\item Show that $s$ is inverse to $r$, and that $f$ is inverse to~$g$.
\item Let $\map{h}{\N}{\N}$ be the function that returns
  $n+1$ if $n$ is even, and returns $n-1$ if $n$ is odd.
  Find a function inverse to~$h$.
\item Show that $\map{t}{\R}{\R}$ given by $t(x)=x^2$
  has no inverse.
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
  Find a pair of maps $\map{f}{D}{C}$ and $\map{g}{C}{D}$
  such that $\composed{g}{f}$ is the identity but $\composed{f}{g}$
  is not.
  (We say that $g$ is a \definend{right inverse} of~$f$, or what is the
  same thing, that $f$ is a \definend{left inverse} of~$g$).
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} Prove each.
\begin{exes}
\item If a function has an inverse then that inverse
  is unique.
\item A function has an inverse if and only if that 
  function is a correspondence.
\item The inverse of a correspondence is a correspondence.  
\item If $f$ and $g$ each is invertable then so is 
  $\composed{g}{f}$, and $(\composed{g}{f})^{-1}=\composed{f^{-1}}{g^{-1}}$.
\end{exes}  
\end{ex}

\section{Relations}
\begin{df}
A \definend{relation} on sets $A_0$, \ldots, $a_{n-1}$ is a subset
$R\subseteq A_0\times \cdots \times A_{n-1}$. 
If all of the sets are the same $a_0=A$, \ldots, $A_{n-1}=A$
then we call it a relation on~$A$.
The number of sets~$n$ is the \definend{arity} of the relation.
and say it is \definend{$n$-ary}.
If the arity is~$2$ then it is a \definend{binary relation}.
In this case, if $R=\setbuilder{(x,y)}{\text{$x\in X$ and $y\in Y$}}$
then where $(x,y)\in R$ we say $x$ is \definend{$R$-related} to~$y$
and sometimes write $xRy$.
\end{df}

\begin{ex}
\begin{exes}
\item List five elements of the relation
  $R=\setbuilder{(x,y)\in \R^2}{x+2=y}$

  its graph is a relation.
\item Let $\map{f}{D}{C}$ be a function.
  Show that 
  $R_f=\setbuilder{(x,y)}{f(x)=f(y)}$
  is a binary relation.
  Where $f(x)=x^2$ with domain and codomain~$\R$,
  list five elements. 
\end{exes}
\end{ex}

\begin{df} 
Let $R$ be a binary relation on a set~$X$.
The relation is \definend{reflexive} if $(x,x)\in R$ for all $x\in X$.
The relation is \definend{symmetric} if $(x,y)\in R$ implies that
$(y,x)\in R$ for all $x,y\in R$.
The relation is \definend{transitive} if 
$(x,y)\in R$ and $(y,z)\in R$ implies that 
$(x,z)\in R$ for all elements $x,y,z\in R$.
A relation that satisfies all three conditions is an
\definend{equivalence relation}.  
\end{df}

\begin{ex}   \pord{} that each is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

\item The ``goes into'' relation
  $D=\setbuilder{(d,m)\in\Z^2}{d\divides m}$.

  is $\setbuilder{(x,x)}{x\in A}$. 
\item
  Where $A$ is a set,
  $E=\setbuilder{(x,y)\in A\times\powerset(A)}{x\in y}$.

we may write $x\equiv y\pmod R$.

A \definend{partition} of a set $X$ is a 
set of nonempty subsets of~$X$ such that every element $x\in X$ 
is in exactly one of these subsets.
That is, a set~$P$ is a partition of $X$ if and only if 
none of its elements is the empty set,
it \definend{covers}~$X$
(the union of the elements of $P$ is equal to~$X$),
and the elements of $P$ are \definend{pairwise disjoint}

\appendix
\chapter{Peano axioms}
\newcommand{\axiom}[1]{\textsc{Axiom~#1}\hspace{.5ex}}

Particularly in the 
first chapter a person struggles with when to consider a 
statement sufficiently justified 
and soon comes to wonder what the axioms are like.
Here we give the most often used axiom system for the natural numbers, to
convey a sense of that. 

This system was 
introduced by Dedekind in 1888 and tuned by Peano in 1889.
In addition to the usual set and logical symbols such as $=$ and $\in$,
with the traditional properties, 
our language will use at least two symbols, $0$ and $S$, whose 
properties are limited by the conditions below.

\begin{ax}[Existence of a natural number]
The constant~$0$ is a natural number.
\end{ax}

\begin{ax}[Arithmetical properties]
The \definend{successor} function~$S$ has these properties.
\begin{exes}
\item \notetext{Closure} For all $a\in\N$, its successor~$S(a)$ is also 
  a natural number.
\item \notetext{One-to-one} For all $a,b\in\N$, if $S(a)=S(b)$ then $a=b$.
\item \notetext{Almost onto}
  For all $a\in\N$, if $a\neq 0$ then there is a $b\in\N$ with $S(b)=a$.
  In contrast, no $c\in\N$ has $0$ as a successor.  
\end{exes}
\end{ax}


These properties give infinitely many natural numbers:
$0$, $S(0)$, $S(S(0))$, etc.
Of course, the notation $0$, $1$, $2$, etc., is less clunky.

\begin{ax}[Induction]
  Suppose that $K$ is a set satisfying that both (i)~$0\in K$
  and (ii)~for all $n\in\N$, if $n\in K$ then $S(n)\in K$.
  Then $K=\N$.
\end{ax}

We prefer an induction variant that changes
condition~(ii) to: for all $n\in\N$, 
if $0\in K$ and $1\in K$ and \ldots\ and $n\in K$ then $S(n)\in K$.
These two variants are inter-derivable but while ours is 
more awkward to state, it is sometimes more convenient to use.

From those axioms we can for instance 
define addition by recursion using successor
\begin{equation*}
  \add(a,n)=
  \begin{cases}
    a             &\text{if $n=0$}  \\
    S(\add(a,m))  &\text{if $n=S(m)$} 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
and then define multiplication by recursion using addition.
\begin{equation*}
  \mul(a,n)=
  \begin{cases}
    0             &\text{if $n=0$}  \\
    \add(\mul(a,m),a)  &\text{if $n=S(m)$} 
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\end{document}

1) Pigeonhole Principle?
  For a non-empty, finite bag of numbers, the maximum value is at 
  least the average value.
