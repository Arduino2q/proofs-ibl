\chapter*{Notes}
The exercises and answers here are associated with the text
\textit{An Inquiry-based Introduction to Proofs}.
See the book's home page
\href{http://joshua.smcvt.edu/proofs}{http://joshua.smcvt.edu/proofs} 
for the details, including the license details and the source code.

That text is structured so that an instructor can adjust the number
of exercises in their version.
After all, you may be teaching a three-credit course, 
or a four-credit course.
Your semester may be fifteen weeks, or may be shorter.
Your students may be somewhat more advanced, or less.
So flexibility with the number of exercises is a help.

If an exercise, or part of an exercise, doesn't make it into the text
then it goes here, with its answer, where
it may be useful for in-class quizzes or take-home problem sets,
or to fine tune the number of problems that your class tackles.

Describing where each exercise goes makes sense but it makes the 
numbering here quirky.
Something like,
``if nothing else changed and this were inserted
in the main text then it would be numbered~$2.3$ part~D''
is a mouthful so instead it will just say, 
``near~$2.3$.''
