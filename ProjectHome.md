This is an introduction to mathematical proof, suitable for US sophomores.

The approach is sometimes called Moore Method, or Discovery Method, or Inquiry-Based Learning.  The book is a sequence of exercises, supplemented with some definitions and remarks.  Usually an instructor will have a class work through these exercises in such a way that students work independently, without relying on each other, outside books, the Internet, etc.  Thus, each person learns by doing.

The material is number theory through the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, sets through De Morgan's Laws, functions through two-sided inverses, and relations through the connection between equivalence relations and partitions.  There is a brief optional chapter on cardinality.
